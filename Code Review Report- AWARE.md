## **Code Review Report: AWARE**

### **Overview**

This review focuses on the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for health data analysis, particularly addressing the following key components:

- Data preprocessing with MICE imputation.
- Building and training a CNN for binary classification.
- Data handling and feature selection.
- Model evaluation and explainability.

### **Summary of Key Findings**

| Issue | Type | Severity | Comment |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 1. Convergence warning during MICE imputation | Bug | Medium | IterativeImputer raises a convergence warning. This may indicate the imputation process is not stopping as expected. |
| 2. Lack of error handling | Improvement | Medium | There is no explicit error handling around file loading, merging, or imputation operations. Using `try-except` blocks can improve robustness. |
| 3. Accuracy as the sole evaluation metric | Enhancement | Medium | Accuracy alone may not be the best metric for health-related data. Consider using metrics like AUC-ROC, F1-score, precision, and recall. |
| 4. Explainability with SHAP and LIME incomplete | Missing Implementation | High | SHAP and LIME are mentioned but not fully integrated. These should be added with corresponding visualizations to explain model predictions. |
| 5. Lack of cross-validation | Enhancement | Medium | Implementing cross-validation would help ensure that model performance generalizes across different subsets of the data. |
| 6. Data Imputation on Empty Data | Bug | High | MICE imputation tries to work on an empty dataframe in some instances due to filtering/merging issues. This needs to be addressed before imputation. |
| 7. Use of CNN for potentially inappropriate data types | Design | Low | The CNN is typically used for image data. If working with time-series or tabular data, other model architectures like LSTM, GRU, or simpler feed-forward networks may be more suitable. |
| 8. Missing feature scaling | Enhancement | Medium | There is no feature scaling applied to numeric columns after imputation, which is generally recommended before training models, especially neural networks. |
| 9. Inline comments and function docstrings | Enhancement | Low | The code has docstrings for functions but lacks inline comments explaining more complex operations, such as model architecture or imputation choices. |
| 10. Outlier handling with Z-scores | Enhancement | Medium | The current Z-score-based outlier removal may not be appropriate for non-normally distributed health data. Consider alternative methods such as IQR (Interquartile Range). |

### **Detailed Review**

#### **1. Convergence Warning in MICE Imputation**

- **Issue**: The IterativeImputer raises a convergence warning during imputation. This means the algorithm failed to reach the stopping criterion in the set number of iterations (10 by default).
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Investigate the data distribution and the missing value patterns. Consider increasing the number of iterations for the imputer, or use different imputation strategies for columns with a large number of missing values.

#### **2. Lack of Error Handling**

- **Issue**: There is no error handling for key operations such as file loading, merging datasets, and imputation. Any failure in these steps could crash the entire pipeline.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Use `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions for operations like file I/O, data processing, and model fitting. Provide meaningful error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue.

```python
try:
    # Load data
    dht_data = pd.read_csv('data/dht_file.csv')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"File not found: {e}")
```

#### **3. Use of Accuracy as the Sole Metric**

- **Issue**: The model is currently evaluated using only accuracy, which may not reflect the true performance for imbalanced health datasets.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Include additional metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, especially if the dataset is imbalanced.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score

# After model predictions:
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compute additional metrics
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"AUC: {auc}, F1: {f1}, Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}")
```

#### **4. Incomplete Integration of SHAP and LIME**

- **Issue**: The notebook mentions SHAP and LIME explainability tools, but they are not fully implemented.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Complete the implementation by adding SHAP summary plots and LIME explanations. This will help interpret the model's predictions.

```python
import shap
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, X_train)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
```

#### **5. Lack of Cross-Validation**

- **Issue**: The model is only trained and validated using a single train-test split. This could lead to biased performance results.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to provide a more robust estimate of model performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
```

#### **6. Data Imputation on Empty Data**

- **Issue**: After merging the datasets, some imputation runs on an empty dataframe due to data filtering issues. This leads to the imputer attempting to fit on an empty dataframe.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Add a check to ensure the dataframe is non-empty before proceeding with imputation.

```python
if not merged_data.empty:
    mice_imputer.fit_transform(merged_data)
else:
    print("No data available for imputation.")
```

#### **7. CNN Design for Tabular Data**

- **Issue**: CNNs are used, which are typically suited for spatial data like images, but may not be ideal for tabular or time-series data.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Consider using models more suited for tabular data such as gradient-boosting models or simple feed-forward networks. If time-series data is being used, LSTMs or GRUs could be more effective.

#### **8. Feature Scaling Missing**

- **Issue**: Feature scaling is essential when training neural networks but is missing in the current implementation.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Apply standardization or normalization to numeric columns before training the CNN.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

#### **9. Inline Comments and Documentation**

- **Issue**: While docstrings are present, there is a lack of detailed inline comments explaining complex sections of the code (e.g., why specific hyperparameters are chosen, why CNNs are used for this task).
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Add more inline comments and expand the docstrings to improve code readability and maintainability.

```python
# CNN architecture with two convolutional layers and a fully connected output
# Each Conv2D layer increases the feature extraction depth (32, 64 filters)
model = Sequential([...])
```

#### **10. Z-score Based Outlier Removal**

- **Issue**: Z-score based outlier removal assumes a normal distribution, which may not be suitable for health data that is often non-normally distributed.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Consider using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to remove outliers, which is more robust to non-normal distributions.

```python
# Alternative outlier removal method: IQR
Q1 = merged_data.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = merged_data.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
filtered_data = merged_data[~((merged_data < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (merged_data > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))).any(axis=1)]
```

### **Conclusion**

The notebook is well-structured and implements important machine learning concepts, but there are several areas that require attention to improve robustness, clarity, and accuracy. Focusing on error handling, evaluation metrics, feature scaling, and model explainability will make the pipeline more reliable and interpretable. With these enhancements, the code will be better suited for research and health-related predictions.
